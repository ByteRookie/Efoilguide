# Online Efoil Guide

A communityâ€‘maintained directory of eFoil spots. The site loads all location data from [`data/locations.csv`](data/locations.csv) and renders it in a filterable table and map.

## Add a location
1. Fork this repository.
2. Add a new line to `data/locations.csv` using the existing headers:  
   `id,name,city,addr,lat,lng,water,season,skill,launch,parking,amenities,pros,cons,pop,best,gear,tips,law`
   * `skill` uses `|` to separate levels (e.g. `B|I|A`).
   * Wrap text that contains commas in double quotes.
   * Cite rules or facts with `{{Citation: "text" SourceName: "Name" SourceURL: "URL"}}`.

### Citation format

Citations let readers verify information about a spot. They can appear in any field that describes regulations, amenities, or other factual claims.

**Basic citation**

```
{{Citation: "Local rule description" SourceName: "Authority Name" SourceURL: "https://example.org/rules"}}
```

**Multiple sources in one citation**

```
{{Citation: "Hydrofoils permitted year-round" SourceName: "City Parks Dept,State Marine Board" SourceURL: "https://city.gov/foils,https://state.gov/marine"}}
```

**Multiple citations in a field**

Fields can contain more than one citation by placing them sequentially:

```
"Launch from the south ramp {{Citation: \"Ramp map\" SourceName: \"Harbor Authority\" SourceURL: \"https://harbor.example\"}} {{Citation: \"Check tide charts\" SourceName: \"NOAA\" SourceURL: \"https://tides.example\"}}"
```

**Example `locations.csv` row**

```
